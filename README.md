The True/False QuizApp is a mobile application designed to provide users with a simple, interactive platform for testing general knowledge through a series of true or false questions. 
Its primary aim is to promote learning through instant feedback and repetition, making it ideal for students and casual learners. The app includes a main menu, quiz interface, score summary, and a review 
page to enhance user understanding and engagement.
From a design perspective, the app demonstrates clear user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) considerations by using intuitive navigation, clear feedback messages, and appropriate UI components 
like buttons and text views. The separation of logic into different activities ensures modularity and maintainability. Features like error handling, score tracking, and disabling buttons after answers 
show thoughtful design choices aimed at usability and robustness. However, improvements could be made by incorporating better scalability techniques, accessibility features, and adopting architectural 
patterns like MVVM for better state management.
In terms of development workflow, the use of GitHub for version control enables efficient collaboration, issue tracking, and documentation. Moreover, integrating GitHub Actions facilitates automation of testing, 
building, and linting processes, enhancing the appâ€™s quality and streamlining deployment. These CI/CD workflows are essential for maintaining code integrity in team environments and ensuring a consistent 
development 
pipeline. Overall, the app is a solid educational tool with potential for expansion and increased maintainability through improved development practices.
